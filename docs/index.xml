It also has been discussed by a lot of Linux content creators. I have been using Linux for the past 10 years as my operating system for everything I do. With this has come challenges, of course years ago it was virtually impossible.
The landscape has shifted for Linux content creators. You really no longer need to purchase Davanchi Studio. The best new player on the block I&amp;rsquo;d recommend is Blender.</description></item><item><title>Malware Analysis for Beginners</title><link>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/docs/malware-analysis-beginner-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/docs/malware-analysis-beginner-guide/</guid><description>Hello everyone, malware analysis is a hot topic lately as the threats we work against in the cybersecurity industry become more advanced with each passing day. This creates demand for these types of skills in the industry. I&amp;rsquo;ve mentored and taught many malware analysts and what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from this experience do not align with certifications. Although certifications are helpful, they are not what I&amp;rsquo;d recommend starting with from scratch. This guide aims to get you started in malware analysis without having to pay anyone any money.</description></item><item><title>KVM Malware Lab Guide</title><link>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/docs/kvm-malware-lab/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/docs/kvm-malware-lab/</guid><description>This is my guide for setting up your very own malware lab using KVM.
Before you start, this guide assumes you have an AirVPN subscription or another equivelent one, which provides a .ovpn file.
NOTE: I like to have internet enabled on my analysis VMs and this comes with extra security considerations and potential risk if you do not perform the setup correctly. It is recommended that you have your KVM host machine on a DMZ.</description></item><item><title>Malware Analysis Tool List</title><link>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/docs/malware-analysis-tools/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/docs/malware-analysis-tools/</guid><description>This document contains an extensive list of the malware analysis tools I use on a regular basis. ðŸ˜„
