Key Points Redline Stealer has the ability to communicate with multiple C2 hosts. Redline Stealer has the ability to present a message box to the user upon execution. Redline Stealer communicates with the C2 server using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Redline Stealer exits if it detects the infected machine is from a near Russian countries.</description></item><item><title>Reversing Additional Lockbit 3.0 API Hashing</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/07/lockbit-api-hashing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/07/lockbit-api-hashing/</guid><description>I was watching @herrcore&amp;rsquo;s OALabs stream on Lockbit 3.0. After he wrote a utility to decrypt additional data from the ransomware, he noticed one of the buffers was a Portable Executable (PE) file. It had an interesting API hashing routine, we would be reversing for the next stream.
I decided to have a closer look. ðŸ˜„
Analysis This is an interesting sample, I have not mapped out its full functionality yet.</description></item><item><title>Qakbot/Qbot Downloader</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2020/02/qakbot-downloader/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2020/02/qakbot-downloader/</guid><description>Situation: I came across an interesting obfuscated sample on Any.Run.
Metadata: db2614353dc6c29dbe323dbeafe6b781 Analysis: The sample has a ton of comments making the file size total around ~4mb.
This was easily parsed out with sed 's/^\x27//'.
The next step is to idenify where code is evaluated which was here exECuTeglOBal sHLW(iDxY).
Changed this to WScript.Echo then also had to backtrack for a variable which defined before the evaluation.
This variable contained an array of strings which contain object names and the downloader URL, User-Agent etc.</description></item><item><title>ViperSoftx Vjw0rm Variant</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2020/02/vjw0rm-vipersoftx-variant/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2020/02/vjw0rm-vipersoftx-variant/</guid><description>Situation: While watching Any.Run for interesting scripts to deobfuscate, I noted that its traffic did appear to be like other variants of vjw0rm however wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure of what else it could do.
Metadata: Sample: 3236312b9dc691dd8b9214f08ff01e5d Analysis The obfuscation techniques are pretty standard, the first stage deobfuscates base64 data then performs mathematic operations on it (I don&amp;rsquo;t give a crap how they work I just let it do the heavy lifting for me), interestingly the base64 string is reversed.</description></item><item><title>Mr. Robot Variant of Vjw0rm</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2020/02/vjw0rm-mr-robot-variant/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2020/02/vjw0rm-mr-robot-variant/</guid><description><![CDATA[I was monitoring Any.Run when a .js file peeked my interest due to the limited network traffic.
