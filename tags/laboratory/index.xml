This creates demand for these types of skills in the industry. I&amp;rsquo;ve mentored and taught many malware analysts and one of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from this experience do not align with certifications. Although certifications are helpful, they are not what I&amp;rsquo;d recommend starting with from scratch. This guide aims to get you started in malware analysis without having to pay anyone any money.</description></item><item><title>KVM Malware Lab Guide</title><link>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/docs/kvm-malware-lab/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/docs/kvm-malware-lab/</guid><description>This is my guide for setting up your very own malware lab using KVM.
Before you start, this guide assumes you have an AirVPN subscription or another equivelent one, which provides a .ovpn file.
NOTE: I like to have internet enabled on my analysis VMs and this comes with extra security considerations and potential risk if you do not perform the setup correcty. It is recommended that you have your KVM host machine on a DMZ.</description></item></channel></rss>
