You might always have that little voice in your head thinking&amp;hellip;
What if I double click by accident?
What if I press ENTER when I was not supposed to?
What if the malware breaks out of the VM?
Malware is bad
You don&amp;rsquo;t want to be infected do you?
If you have these little voices in your head, you are not alone.</description></item><item><title>Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering Workflow</title><link>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/documents/malware-analysis-reversing-workflow/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/documents/malware-analysis-reversing-workflow/</guid><description>I have noticed that there is a lot of material on individual parts of the malware analysis and reverse engineering process. However, they do not cover really what someone&amp;rsquo;s workflow is from start to finish. This guide will be an overview of my general workflow.
Prerequsites Ensure you have finished setting up your malware lab This guide is not how everyone does it, everyone will refine their own workflow, which works best for them overtime. Methodology When working on malware it is good to have a methodology to guide your operations.</description></item><item><title>Malware Analysis for Beginners</title><link>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/documents/malware-analysis-beginner-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/documents/malware-analysis-beginner-guide/</guid><description>Hello everyone, malware analysis is a hot topic lately as the threats we work against in the cybersecurity industry become more advanced with each passing day. This creates demand for these types of skills in the industry. I&amp;rsquo;ve mentored and taught many malware analysts and what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from this experience do not align with certifications. Although certifications are helpful, they are not what I&amp;rsquo;d recommend starting with from scratch. This guide aims to get you started in malware analysis without having to pay anyone any money.</description></item><item><title>KVM Malware Lab Guide</title><link>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/documents/kvm-malware-lab/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/documents/kvm-malware-lab/</guid><description>This is my guide for setting up your very own malware lab using KVM.
Before you start, this guide assumes you have an AirVPN subscription or another equivalent one, which provides a .ovpn file.
NOTE: I like to have internet enabled on my analysis VMs and this comes with extra security considerations and potential risk if you do not perform the setup correctly. It is recommended that you have your KVM host machine on a DMZ.</description></item></channel></rss>
