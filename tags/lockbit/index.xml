Protected with .NET Reactor I obtained a sample of DarkCloud Stealer from @James_inthe_box, which is a 7zip compressed (fc55a2bd0a266b8eca264b9b74afff9d373746910035d18c901ac718b6c3948f). Once extracted, it results in the file FILENAME (3dbcb27a7f441b6f3d6e47d9ae69c69a1af582b3e5c0dce44642e5d0ad0cf566), which is packed with .NET reactor.
Persistence Next, it establishes persistence with the command.
&amp;quot;C:\Windows\System32\schtasks.exe&amp;quot; /Create /TN &amp;quot;Updates\jDDrSpcG&amp;quot; /XML &amp;quot;C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\tmp3332.tmp&amp;quot; PE Injection Once persistence is established, it will create the new process RegSvcs.exe, to perform PE injection. Next, it writes DarkCloud to this new process and resuming the thread.</description></item><item><title>Reversing Additional Lockbit 3.0 API Hashing</title><link>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/malware-blog/lockbit-v3-api-hashing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/malware-blog/lockbit-v3-api-hashing/</guid><description>I was watching @herrcore&amp;rsquo;s OALabs stream on Lockbit 3.0. After he wrote a utility to decrypt additional data from the ransomware, he noticed one of the buffers was a Portable Executable (PE) file. It had an interesting API hashing routine, we would be reversing for the next stream.
I decided to have a closer look. 😄
Analysis This is an interesting sample, I have not mapped out its full functionality yet.
However, I was able to get a decent amount of reversing done, which should give us more of an insight.</description></item></channel></rss>
