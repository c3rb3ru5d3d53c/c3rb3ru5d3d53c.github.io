After he wrote a utility to decrypt additional data from the ransomware, he noticed one of the buffers was a Portable Executable (PE) file. It had an interesting API hashing routine, we would be reversing for the next stream.
I decided to have a closer look. 😄
Analysis This is an interesting sample, I have not mapped out its full functionality yet.
However, I was able to get a decent amount of reversing done, which should give us more of an insight.</description></item><item><title>Making Fun of Your APT Malware - Bitter APT Using ZxxZ Backdoor to Target Pakistan Public Accounts Committee</title><link>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/malware-blog/2022-07-04-bitter-apt-zxxz-backdoor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/malware-blog/2022-07-04-bitter-apt-zxxz-backdoor/</guid><description>Introduction Bitter APT (T-APT-17/APT-C-08/Orange Yali) is a group known to operate in South Asia and is suspected to be an Indian 🇮‍🇳 APT.
