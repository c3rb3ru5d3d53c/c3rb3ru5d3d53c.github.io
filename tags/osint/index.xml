Starting with AlexxModder I received a Discord message from the user AlexxModder asking me to be a developer for their malware project. I was not inclined to participate but rather to analyze the code. So I stated Send me the source code, I then received the source code as ELYSc2.zip (Figure placeholder).
Figure placeholder: AlexModder sending botnet source code.
Next, we investigated the next persona, which was obtained by visiting the site https[:]//elys.</description></item></channel></rss>
