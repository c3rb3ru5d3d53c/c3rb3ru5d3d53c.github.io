This creates demand for these types of skills in the industry. I&amp;rsquo;ve mentored and taught many malware analysts and what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from this experience do not align with certifications. Although certifications are helpful, they are not what I&amp;rsquo;d recommend starting with from scratch. This guide aims to get you started in malware analysis without having to pay anyone any money.</description></item><item><title>KVM Malware Lab Guide</title><link>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/docs/kvm-malware-lab/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/docs/kvm-malware-lab/</guid><description>This is my guide for setting up your very own malware lab using KVM.
Before you start, this guide assumes you have an AirVPN subscription or another equivalent one, which provides a .ovpn file.
NOTE: I like to have internet enabled on my analysis VMs and this comes with extra security considerations and potential risk if you do not perform the setup correctly. It is recommended that you have your KVM host machine on a DMZ.</description></item><item><title>Qakbot/QBot Downloader</title><link>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/malware-blog/2020-02-12-qakbot-downloader/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/malware-blog/2020-02-12-qakbot-downloader/</guid><description>Situation:
I came across an interesting obfuscated sample on Any.Run.
Metadata:
db2614353dc6c29dbe323dbeafe6b781 Analysis:
The sample has a ton of comments making the file size total around ~4mb.
This was easily parsed out with sed &amp;rsquo;s/^\x27//&amp;rsquo;.
The next step is to idenify where code is evaluated which was here exECuTeglOBal sHLW(iDxY).
Changed this to WScript.Echo then also had to backtrack for a variable which defined before the evaluation.
This variable contained an array of strings which contain object names and the downloader URL, User-Agent etc.</description></item><item><title>ViperSoftx Vjw0rm Variant</title><link>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/malware-blog/2020-02-10-vjw0rm-vipersoftx-variant/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/malware-blog/2020-02-10-vjw0rm-vipersoftx-variant/</guid><description>Situation:
While watching Any.Run for interesting scripts to deobfuscate, I noted that its traffic did appear to be like other variants of vjw0rm however wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure of what else it could do.

Sample: 3236312b9dc691dd8b9214f08ff01e5d Analysis
The obfuscation techniques are pretty standard, the first stage deobfuscates base64 data then performs mathematic operations on it (I don&amp;rsquo;t give a crap how they work I just let it do the heavy lifting for me), interestingly the base64 string is reversed.</description></item><item><title>Mr. Robot Variant of Vjw0rm</title><link>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/malware-blog/2020-02-01-vjw0rm-mr-robot-variant/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c3rb3ru5d3d53c.github.io/malware-blog/2020-02-01-vjw0rm-mr-robot-variant/</guid><description>I was monitoring Any.Run when a .js file peeked my interest due to the limited network traffic.
Analysis Metadata:
Name: 1.js MD5 : 3f438e857c45a4812dbfa331fd3b8011 The first stage decrypts a long Unicode string then calls eval on its result as seen in Figure 1.
function y(o,h) { var t;var s=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;; var d=(o+&amp;quot;&amp;quot;).split(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;); for (var i=0;i&amp;lt;d.length;i++){ t=d[i].charCodeAt(0); s+=String.fromCharCode(256-+t+(+h)); } return s; } WScript.Sleep(10000); eval(&amp;quot;eval(y(\&amp;quot;&amp;lt;long_unicode_string&amp;gt;\&amp;quot;&amp;quot;); Figure 1: Deobfuscation routine
When threat actor(s) use eval, most of the time I can easily bypass this with replacing it with console.</description></item></channel></rss>
