> Q: If someone exploits software, firmware, or hardware...does that make them a malware developer?

FACT: An exploit is code designed to take advantage of a security flaw or vulnerability, in an application or computer system, typically for malicious purposes.

FACT: Additionally, malware is defined as malicious software. 

FACT: Permanent software programmed into a read-only memory.

A: If someone create an exploit, this is code usually created with malicious intent, as such can be considered malware and the person who created it a developer.

A: Firmware could be exploited, as a result this code could be created with malicious intent, as such can be considered malware and the person who created a developer.

A: Hardware could be exploited using hardware or software or a combination of both. As a result, any software developed for its exploitation could be considered malware if it's created with malicious intent,  the creation of the software would make the person who created it a developer.

Summary: Typically, a malware developer writes malicious software with more features that are not necessarily just exploits. Whereas,  an exploit developer is a term that better describes a person who writes malicious software with the sole purpose of exploiting systems without the additional features. For the most part yes, it does make them a malware developer. However, there are exceptions, limitations and better terms to describe them, which is covered in the aforementioned answers provided.
