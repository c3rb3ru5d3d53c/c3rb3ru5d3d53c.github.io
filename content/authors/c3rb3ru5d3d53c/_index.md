## About the Author

Hey everyone! I'm __c3rb3ru5d3d53c__. :smile: I'm a malware analyst and reverse engineer who has been in the cybersecurity industry now about 7 years. I've worked on everything from APT malware to popular crimeware.

I'm also the developer of [binlex](https://github.com/c3rb3ru5d3d53c/binlex) and [mwcfg](https://github.com/c3rb3ru5d3d53c/mwcfg).

I have a huge passion for genetic binary analysis and much more.

I'm a reverse engineer by day and a developer by night.
