2023-06-28 but no thanks, i&amp;#39;ll pass on your request. I have a question though...
If someone exploits software, firmware, or hardware...does that make them a malware developer?
&amp;mdash; Jonathan Scott (@jonathandata1) June 28, 2023 Q: If someone exploits software, firmware, or hardware&amp;hellip;does that make them a malware developer?
FACT: An exploit is code designed to take advantage of a security flaw or vulnerability, in an application or computer system, typically for malicious purposes.</description></item><item><title>ANGR Python Scripting Cheatsheet</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2023/06/angr-python-cheatsheet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2023/06/angr-python-cheatsheet/</guid><description>ANGR Python CheatSheet Starting a Project 1 2 3 4 5 import angr, claripy # Create the Project p = angr.Project(&amp;#34;stealer.exe&amp;#34;) # Terminate Project Execution p.terminate_execution() Creating Project Hooks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # Hook an Address skip_bytes = 4 @p.hook(0xdeadbeef, length=skip_bytes) def hook_state(s): # Change State Here # Check If Address Hooked (Bool) p.is_hooked(0xdeadbeef) Creating a State 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 start_address = 0xdeadbeef end_address = 0xbeefdead avoid_address = 0xcafef00d # Create Blank State s = p.</description></item><item><title>Linux TTS Accessibility with Festival</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2023/03/linux-tts-with-festival/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2023/03/linux-tts-with-festival/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>Introduction A portfolio website showcases immediate value to employers because it provides a platform to demonstrate your skills, creativity, and achievements. By presenting your best work, you can show employers what you can bring to the table and how you can contribute to their organization. A portfolio website also shows that you are proactive and take pride in your work, which can be attractive to employers who are looking for self-motivated and passionate candidates.</description></item><item><title>Hunting Opaque Predicates with YARA</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2023/02/opaque-predicate-hunting-with-yara/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2023/02/opaque-predicate-hunting-with-yara/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>Introduction Malware tends to obfuscate itself using many different techniques from opaque predicates, garbage code, control flow manipulation with the stack and more. These techniques definitely make analysis more challening for reverse engineers. However, from a detection and hunting standpoint to find interesting samples to reverse engineer we can leverage our knowlege of these techniques to hunt for obfuscated code. In our case today, we will be developing a yara signature to hunt for one specific technique of opaque predicates, there are many variations and situations where this does not match and should only serve as a hunting signatures as more heuristic and programitic approaches for this are better for detection.</description></item><item><title>Fish as a User Shell in Linux</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2023/02/fish-user-shell/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2023/02/fish-user-shell/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>Introduction The purpose of this article is to provide reasoning behind why I&rsquo;m a fish shell user and how to I setup fish 🐟 shell on all my Linux machines. Before we begin, we need to understand what fish shell is.
Fish is a Unix shell with a focus on interactivity and usability. Fish is designed to give the user features by default, rather than by configuration. Fish is considered an exotic shell since it does not rigorously adhere to POSIX shell standards, at the discretion of the maintainers.]]></description></item><item><title>Ghidra Python Scripting Cheatsheet</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2023/02/ghidra-python-cheatsheet.en.md/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2023/02/ghidra-python-cheatsheet.en.md/</guid><description><![CDATA[This is a cheatsheet I use for Ghidra scripting.

I was not sure at the time what the solution would be. However, after some thought; I thought about LD_PRELOAD and using it to hook specific functions. I figured, well it probably won&amp;rsquo;t allow the hooking of libc, but in reality it does. This is of course interesting behavior that can be leveraged for offensive and defensive security research practices.</description></item><item><title>Destroying Redline Stealer and CypherIT</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/11/redline-stealer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 21:57:40 +0800</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/11/redline-stealer/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>Situation Muta from SomeOrdinaryGamers uploaded a video on Redline Stealer on Aug 14, 2022, which infected Martin Shkreli. The purpose of this analysis is to destroy Redline Stealer (specifically the version that infected Martin Shkreli), beginning to end. We will be writing our own configuration extractor, compiling our own version of Redline Stealer in Visual Studio (without source code), write detection signature and tear apart every aspect of the attack chain.</description></item><item><title>Twitch Streaming Live Chat for OBS</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/11/twitch-live-chat/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/11/twitch-live-chat/</guid><description>Twitch Live Stream Chat
