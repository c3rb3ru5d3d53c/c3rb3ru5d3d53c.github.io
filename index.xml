I was not sure at the time what the solution would be. However, after some thought; I thought about LD_PRELOAD and using it to hook specific functions. I figured, well it probably won&amp;rsquo;t allow the hooking of libc, but in reality it does. This is of course interesting behavior that can be leveraged for offensive and defensive security research practices.</description></item><item><title>Reversing RedLine Stealer</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/11/redline-stealer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 21:57:40 +0800</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/11/redline-stealer/</guid><description>Situation Muta from SomeOrdinaryGamers uploaded a video on Redline Stealer on Aug 14, 2022, which infected Martin Shkreli.

The adoption of the language by malware authors spreads like cancer the longer it is in active development. This is due to convenient static linking and support for many operating systems, yielding a binary with little to no dependencies. These features are excellent for the distribution of malware. Every time we need to reverse engineer a Rust binary, we would rather embrace the sweet release of death.</description></item><item><title>What is a DLL?</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/07/what-is-a-dll/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/07/what-is-a-dll/</guid><description>Introduction Hey everybody, it&amp;rsquo;s cerberus and welcome to malware hell. Today we are going to do a whiteboard session on what a DLL is and why it is important to malware reverse engineering and analysis.
Dynamic-link library (DLL) is Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s implementation of the shared library concept in the Microsoft Windows and OS/2 operating systems. These libraries usually have the file extension DLL, OCX (for libraries containing ActiveX controls), or DRV (for legacy system drivers).</description></item><item><title>Reversing Additional Lockbit 3.0 API Hashing</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/07/lockbit-api-hashing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/07/lockbit-api-hashing/</guid><description>I was watching @herrcore&amp;rsquo;s OALabs stream on Lockbit 3.0. After he wrote a utility to decrypt additional data from the ransomware, he noticed one of the buffers was a Portable Executable (PE) file. It had an interesting API hashing routine, we would be reversing for the next stream.
I decided to have a closer look. ðŸ˜„
Analysis This is an interesting sample, I have not mapped out its full functionality yet.</description></item><item><title>Deobfuscating Scripts</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/07/malware-script-deobfuscation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/07/malware-script-deobfuscation/</guid><description>I reached out on Twitter asking for suggestions on new topics to cover.
One of these topics was on deobfuscation of scripts. This is a great topic as this skill can generally be learned by anyone who understands writing code or scripts. I&amp;rsquo;ll cover more advanced topics as I move forward with these guides.
NOTE: This guide does not cover all aspects of deobfuscation. However, once you have finished reading and practicing the concepts in this guide, you will be able to build some of your own techniques to better expand your skills.</description></item><item><title>Handling Malware Samples</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/07/malware-sample-handling/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/07/malware-sample-handling/</guid><description>When you are first starting out in malware analysis or reverse engineering, it can be a very nerve racking experience to deal with malware samples. You might always have that little voice in your head thinking&amp;hellip;
What if I double click by accident?
What if I press ENTER when I was not supposed to?
What if the malware breaks out of the VM?
Malware is bad
You don&amp;rsquo;t want to be infected, do you?</description></item><item><title>Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering Workflow</title><link>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/07/malware-reversing-workflow/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>c3rb3ru5d3d53c</author><guid>https://c3rb3r3u5d3d53c.github.io/2022/07/malware-reversing-workflow/</guid><description>I have noticed that there is a lot of material on individual parts of the malware analysis and reverse engineering process. However, they do not cover really what someone&amp;rsquo;s workflow is from start to finish. This guide will be an overview of my general workflow.
Prerequsites Ensure you have finished setting up your malware lab This guide is not how everyone does it, everyone will refine their own workflow, which works best for them overtime.</description></item></channel></rss>
